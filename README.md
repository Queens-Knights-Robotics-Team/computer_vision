## Creating a Python Environment 
### Create a python environment
Windows:
```
python -m venv name_of_env 
```
Mac: 
```
python3 -m venv name_of_env
```

### Active Python environment
Windows:
```
name_of_env\Scripts\activate
```
Mac: 
```
source name_of_env/bin/activate
```
* Each time you work in the repo on your local machine, ensure your are working in your environment

### Add python environment to .gitignore
In the `.gitignore` file add your environment like this:
```
name_of_env/
```
Click `Ctrl + S` to save the `.gitignore`.

You should now see your environment is shaded out and if you type `git status` in the terminal the environment will not be shown.
