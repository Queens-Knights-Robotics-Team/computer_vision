# Creating a Python environment

1. **Create a python environment** 
    - Windows: python -m venv "name of env" 
    - Mac: python3 -m venv "name of env"

2. **Active python environment**
    - Windows: "name of env"\Scripts\activate
    - Mac: source "name of env"/bin/activate

3. **Add python environment to .gitignore**
    - write in .gitignore: "name of env"/

4. **Save .gitignore file**
    - You will now see that the environment file is shaded out. This means it will not be added to github
    
5. **Work in your environment each time you work on the project**
